# Sub-agent Route

Use this workflow after the Sub-agent route has been selected under [`agent_docs/workflows/route_selection.md`](route_selection.md).

## Main-Agent Role

You are the active top-level agent and therefore the main agent, regardless of which compatible coding-agent product is running. Own direction, planning, work-package boundaries, native-subagent coordination, integration, targeted critical review, `agent_docs/project_progress.md`, and `agent_docs/latest_session_work.md`.

When the active runtime is Codex, the top-level orchestrator must run `gpt-5.6-sol` with `medium` reasoning. Every spawned worker, regardless of role, must run `gpt-5.6-luna` with `high` reasoning. Pass these worker overrides explicitly when the spawn interface exposes them; otherwise use a role whose configuration guarantees that model and effort. If the top-level session does not match the required orchestrator model and effort, stop before repository work and ask the user to relaunch the session with the required top-level model.

Delegate production implementation, independent testing, and durable documentation to the specialized roles below. Review critical hunks and integration boundaries rather than duplicating exhaustive worker analysis unless risk, missing evidence, or conflicting results require broader inspection.

Use only workers supplied natively by the active runtime. Never launch Codex or another external coding-agent runtime through CLI, SDK, API, MCP, or subprocess. If suitable native workers are unavailable, immediately use the Direct-route fallback defined in [`agent_docs/workflows/route_selection.md`](route_selection.md); remain in deployment state and retain the plan, acceptance criteria, verification gates, and documentation duties.

In this route, for common queries, it's not necessary to implement complex workflows or call subagents for simple tasks.

## Plans and Status Writes

When the user says **"plan the implementation for..."** or explicitly requests a detailed implementation plan, persist the plan and stop. Do not begin implementation until the user explicitly approves the plan or asks to implement it. Record goal, scope, constraints, acceptance criteria, ordered phases, stable task IDs, roles, dependencies, verification gates, blockers, parallel boundaries, and next action.

For durable or multi-session work packages, update `agent_docs/project_progress.md` at most twice:

1. Mark the package active and record its bounded plan.
2. Reconcile final status, verification evidence, blockers, and next action.

Do not update it after every checkpoint. Preserve traceability when a plan changes.

Do not write status documents for short-lived packages. Write `agent_docs/latest_session_work.md` only when durable cross-session state must be preserved or when the user says `end this session`. Replace rather than accumulate; do not use it as live scratch state.

## Delegation

Use a proportionate number of native workers based on task scope, complexity, and opportunities for meaningful delegation. The names below define responsibilities. When the active runtime does not expose these exact role names, use the closest native role or mode and include the corresponding responsibilities in its assignment:

- `explorer`: read-only investigation of assigned code, tools, applications, libraries, or configuration; reports findings to the main agent.
- `executor_luna`: default production implementation.
- `executor_sol`: only for exceptionally difficult, broad, cross-cutting work that cannot be narrowed effectively;
         never more than one.
- `tester`: focused independent tests and failure analysis.
- `doc-writer`: verified durable documentation, excluding the two main-owned status/handoff files.

When the active runtime supports an equivalent isolated-context option, start each worker without inherited conversation history. Runtime-specific controls such as Codex's `fork_turns="none"` apply only when that runtime exposes them; never emulate a missing control by invoking another agent product. The initial task capsule must be self-contained and at most 400 words. Use these fixed fields: task ID, outcome, ownership, acceptance criteria, source paths, validation, protected areas, and return format. Include only the minimum initial context grouped as:

- documents to read;
- source files, tests, interfaces, or call sites to inspect;
- the expected edit surface, or investigation scope for read-only roles;
- important protected or out-of-scope areas.

The task capsule defines the worker's strict context, working scope, acceptance criteria, and assigned surface; the main agent owns all four. Do not repeat the conversation, stable role rules, project summaries, recorded requirements, or exhaustive test matrices in a capsule. Workers may inspect adjacent dependencies only to diagnose a blocker, but must not expand their edit scope themselves. They report the blocker, concrete evidence, and proposed files to the main agent, then wait for a re-coordinated next iteration that explicitly amends scope and ownership. The main agent is responsible for resolving overlap before issuing that iteration.

Use `explorer` when the main agent needs a bounded investigation of peripheral or unfamiliar code, tools, applications, libraries, or configuration. Core project documents, core modules, and components central to the current work must still be read directly by the main agent.

Start only `executor_luna` initially for production implementation. Spawn the tester only after the executor hands off completed implementation with its smallest relevant self-check, unless parallel test research has clear independent value. Delegate documentation after verification and only for durable architecture, structure, workflow, public behavior, decisions, or usage changes. Split executor packages only when modules and files are genuinely independent; do not maximize concurrency for its own sake. This worker-concurrency restriction does not prohibit local batching of independent tool calls inside the active agent thread.

Assignments and follow-ups must be deltas, normally no more than 120 words. Do not resend full test matrices, recorded requirements, old logs, the initial capsule, or the conversation. A follow-up should contain only work-package ID, iteration, changed files/state, new evidence, affected acceptance criterion, and next action.

Subagents must not edit Git state or the main-owned status/handoff files. Worker communication is event-driven. Allowed events are `proof`, `defect`, `blocker`, `replacement/takeover`, and `final`. Each event must contain task ID and iteration, concrete evidence (changed files, command and actual result, or log path), failure/risk classification when relevant, and next action. Events are capped at 100 words and final reports at 250 words. Intent-only updates such as "implementing now" are not checkpoints.

## Local Tool-Call Batching

Worker-concurrency limits govern the number and lifecycle of subagents. They do not prohibit independent tool-call concurrency inside one agent thread.

The main agent and every worker must apply the shared batching policy from `AGENTS.md` within each bounded stage.

Typical batches include:

- Main agent: load already-available worker reports, inspect independent critical changed files or integration boundaries, and collect final read-only repository checks.
- Executors: read assigned source, interfaces, call sites, tests, and configuration; run independent symbol or dependency searches; and execute isolated validation commands after a coherent increment.
- Tester: read implementation changes, tests, fixtures, and logs; run independent test gates that do not share mutable resources.
- Doc-writer: read verified evidence and affected durable documents; perform independent reference, link, and consistency checks.

Agent lifecycle operations remain sequential and event-driven. Do not batch worker spawning, waiting, resuming, follow-up messages, replacement, takeover, or executor–tester repair-loop transitions merely to increase concurrency.

Do not repeat this stable batching policy in task capsules or follow-up deltas. Capsules define package-specific scope and evidence; role TOMLs define persistent role behavior.

## Thread Lifecycle and Waiting

Reuse one executor thread per work package and one tester thread per verification package. Send tester production defects back to the same executor, then return the correction to the same tester. Repair loops respond only to new evidence.

If a worker returns no concrete evidence, send one short delta retry. A second consecutive evidence-free turn requires replacement when another suitable native worker is available. The replacement must produce concrete evidence on its first turn. If both the original and replacement fail, or no native replacement exists, announce the loss of independent execution and continue the package through the Direct-route fallback as the main agent.

Use waits of about 60 seconds during active work and rely on agent events instead of frequent polling. Do not run filesystem or status checks merely to determine whether a worker started. Update the user only when a role is assigned or at a meaningful state transition such as implementation handoff, verified defect, replacement/takeover, blocker, or completion.

Store long build/test logs under `/tmp`. Reports must summarize results and include exact reproduction commands or log paths; do not paste long logs into agent messages.

## Execution and Verification

1. Executor implements a coherent increment and runs the smallest relevant check.
2. Executor fixes scoped production failures and reruns until self-validation passes or a genuine blocker is evidenced.
3. Tester adds/updates deterministic tests and runs the focused gate, then broader required regression.
4. Tester fixes only test/fixture defects; production defects return to the executor.
5. Repeat only in response to new evidence. Never weaken validation or claim unrun checks passed.
6. Stop the executor-tester loop after 3 iterations per work package without a green focused gate; report to the user and await a decision rather than continuing to cycle.

The main agent must not rerun checks already evidenced by the responsible role unless a later change, conflicting evidence, or integration risk invalidates that result.

Keep changes within plan boundaries. Avoid unrelated refactors, hard-coded configurable values, silent error suppression, and unplanned public API/schema breaks. Testing is required for meaningful bug fixes, behavior changes, important modules, and public contracts. Prefer local deterministic fixtures over network dependencies.

Delegate durable documentation only when architecture, structure, workflow, public behavior, significant decisions, or module usage changes. Provide verified facts and exact target files.

At the end of each shift, report back in a simple table format: which worker responsibilities were used (explorer, executor_luna, tester, doc-writer), their native runtime names when different, and the number of times each was called.

## Blockers

Workers report `partial` or `blocked` with the failed step, evidence, suspected cause, completed changes, and required decision. The main agent records material blockers and adjusts the plan. If a required role is unavailable, explicitly enter the Direct-route fallback rather than silently changing execution mode or invoking an external coding agent.

## End-of-Session Handoff

Run this section only when the user directly commands the exact phrase `end this session`, ignoring capitalization and surrounding punctuation.

1. Collect checkpoints only from running or incomplete workers.
2. Confirm verification occurred after the last relevant code/test change; do not rerun solely because the session is ending.
3. Complete warranted durable documentation first.  If a doc-writer thread already exists, it may perform compact read-only integrity checks; do not spawn one solely for status checks.  Update `project_diary.md` only for significant decisions or lessons.
4. If meaningful project files changed and a suitable native read-only worker is available, spawn or reuse one `explorer` (using isolated context when supported) for a bounded `SESSION-CLOSURE-AUDIT`. The explorer performs read-only repository closure checks and returns directly to the main agent; it must not edit files, Git state, `project_progress.md`, or `latest_session_work.md`. If no such native worker is available, the main agent performs the same bounded audit in one read-only batch under the Direct-route fallback.
5. Scope the explorer audit to changed-file counts, insertion/deletion totals, whitespace/error checks, the largest unignored file, material generated/ignored payloads, unexpected changed surfaces, and blockers.  It may confirm existing verification evidence and report paths but must not rerun tests solely for closure or review central implementation correctness.
6. Require a compact explorer final, normally no more than 150 words, containing: `status`, `changed_files`, `insertions`, `deletions`, `largest_unignored_file`, `generated_payloads`, `diff_check`, `unexpected_scope`, and `blockers`.  Do not request full file listings unless the explorer finds an anomaly.
7. The main agent consumes that audit without repeating the same repository-wide status, diff-stat, or large-file scans unless the explorer reports a defect, evidence conflicts, or later unexpected changes invalidate the audit.  The main agent still performs targeted critical review and owns the final scope decision.
8. Empty `project_progress.md` content if the plan is complete; otherwise reconcile it with final status, verification evidence, blockers, and next action when its recorded state changed.  Replace `latest_session_work.md` once with changes, verification, pending work, and the next entry point.  These two files remain exclusively under main-agent authority.
9. After the main-owned status writes, run only compact checks needed to cover those predictable edits.  Escalate to broader inspection only on failure or unexpected scope.
10. If meaningful project files changed, run `git add .`, commit quietly with `git commit --quiet -m "[auto commit] <summary>"`, and report only the one-line commit identity plus any remaining dirty state.

If no meaningful project files changed, do not spawn the closure explorer and no need to refresh `latest_session_work.md`.

Every completed session should leave honest status, bounded changes, current verification, preserved user work, and a clear continuation point.
